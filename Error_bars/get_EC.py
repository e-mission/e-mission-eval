    '''
    Finds the expected mean energy consumption and variance for a single trip.
    It uses the primary mode and the trip distance to calculate the mean, rather than using section modes and distances.
    The variance is calculated with variance propagation of the energy intensity variance and the trip length variance.

    ct:                     confirmed trip. A row of a labeled trips dataframe.
    unit_dist_MCS_df:       dataframe containing the mean and variance of trip length for a 1 unit long trip, for both operating systems.

    android_EI_moments:     dataframe of energy intensity mean and variance for each mode sensed with android.
    ios_EI_moments:         dataframe of energy intensity mean and variance for each mode sensed with ios.
    energy_dict:            dictionary by mode of energy intensity in kWH

    EI_length_covariance:   (assumed to be 0). covariance between trip energy intensity and trip length.
        To use this, we would need to either find a value based on past user labels or estimate this with sensed energy consumption.
        I'm not sure whether this should be different for different sensed modes (ie, use a covariance conditional on sensed mode), 
        since knowing the sensed mode tells us more information about the energy consumption than if we had no knowledge.

        With all CEO + stage user labels, I estimated EI_length covariance as 1.29.
        You might also need to add the covariance to each trip energy consumption estimate since E[XY] = E[X]E[Y] + cov(X,Y), 
        but this might overestimate energy consumption if we use a covariance of 1.2 for every trip, 
        which would be similar to assigning short trips to drove alone or a higher intensity mode.
